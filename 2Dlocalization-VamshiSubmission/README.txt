To run the 2D Grid Localization 

1. Change your Matlab current working directory to this folder.
2. Run 'localization.m' file.
3. Four figures will pop-out.
4. You can observe the sense and move probabilities variations in gray scale(as explained in the report).
5. We can also try this with various combinations of initial probabilities, world, sense measurements, motion parameters.

Cheers!
